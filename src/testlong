This is a long test. It's long because we demand it to be long. If we didn't demand it to be long then it wouldn't be long. Thus it would be a terrible long test and should and would be named something else. For example, misleading test would be appropriate. That is, it was named long test but wasn't indeed a long test. Is this long enough yet? I wonder... but I wonder more than just this. Sometimes I wonder how the sun, moon, and planets came into existence. They say... HA! "They", who is "they"? We always say "they" but do we really know who "they" are? I think not. And with that I end my rant.
